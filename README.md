# Stock_Analysis with VBA


### 1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

While working on this project, I was able to incoporate my excel skills, along with my new VBA coding skills. The purpose of this project was to help Steve create a report that will help analyze new stocks for his parents to invest. While running the yearly stock reports of 2017 and 2018, we are also coding the time it takes to loop through all the data once. Then we will be comparing the refactored code to the original code to determine which analysis took longer.

### 2. Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
#Stock Performance

#Stock Report Execution Time
For the original code, we were using coding that included nested looping. The nested loop coding seem to have taken longer than the code with individualizing each loop. For example, Image A and C shows the original script report time, while Image B and D shows the refactored script report time.

### 3. Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
